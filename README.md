# VEO TTS

This project translates text from any language into English and generates video and audio using the VEO 3 Text to Video model from Google on the Replicate platform. Kazakh is shown as an example, but you can use any language.

## Dependencies
- replicate: https://replicate.com/google/veo-3/api
- deep-translator
- moviepy

## Usage Example
```python
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run `veo_tts.py` or use the function in your own code.
```

**Note:** I have not tested the code yet. However, I believe it should work as intended. If it does not, I trust you have understood the main idea of the project.
